Githeri Variations

    In Kenya, dried corn and beans are used. The beans and corn are put in a pot with water and simmered for several hours until softened. Use any kind of beans: pinto beans, kidney beans, cowpeas (black-eyed peas), green peas, groundnuts, pigeon peas.
    To give the dish more flavor and texture, add some chopped greens, sauteed onions, cubed potatoes or cassava, stew meat or a little curry powder.
